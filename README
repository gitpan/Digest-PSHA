Digest-PSHA version 0.50
========================

This module was written to support P_SHA-1 and P_SHA256
digest (pseudorandom function) described in RFC 4346 and RFC 5246.

P_hash(secret, seed) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(1) + seed) +
                              HMAC_hash(secret, A(2) + seed) +
                              HMAC_hash(secret, A(3) + seed) + ...

   Where + indicates concatenation.

   A() is defined as:

       A(0) = seed
       A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))
